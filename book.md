Project Significance
Addresses critical challenges in Egypt's blood donation ecosystem:
•	30% blood shortage in emergency cases
•	Limited donor tracking systems
•	Fragmented hospital blood inventories
•	Low public awareness of donation opportunities
Existing Systems Analysis
•	Egyptian Blood Services Organization (limited digital presence)
•	Hospital-specific donor databases (fragmented)
•	International models: American Red Cross Blood Donor App
Key Challenges Identified
1.	Donor retention rates below 20% in Egypt
2.	Manual inventory tracking leading to 15% blood wastage
3.	Emergency response times averaging +4 hours
